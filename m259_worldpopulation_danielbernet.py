# 1. Introduction

Welcome to the world population dataset project for the ÜK-Module 259! In this project, I'll be exploring the historical population data for every country/territory in the world. My primary objective is to analyze this data using the CRISP-DM methodology and derive meaningful insights regarding population trends, growth rates, and other related factors.

## Project Objectives

1. Perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset.
2. Formulate and test hypotheses based on the EDA findings.
3. Model and analyze the population growth rates using different algorithms.
4. Summarize the results and discuss the implications.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about various countries/territories, including their populations at different years, area size, density, and growth rates. This data is valuable for understanding global population trends and can provide insights into factors that influence population growth.

I will use this dataset to explore questions such as:
- How has the world population changed over the years?
- Which countries have experienced the highest population growth rates?
- Are there any correlations between population density and growth rates?

By analyzing this data, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of global population dynamics and take conclusions.

# 2. Data Understanding

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

In this chapter, we will perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the world population dataset. The EDA will include summary statistics for numerical columns, distribution plots for numerical columns, count plots for categorical columns, a correlation matrix to understand relationships between variables, and any other relevant visualizations or analyses.

## Null-values check

We will perform a check for null or missing values in the dataset. Null values can significantly impact the quality and reliability of our analyses and models. Therefore, it is essential to identify and handle them appropriately. Additionally, we will discuss strategies for handling null values, such as imputation or removal, depending on the nature and quantity of missing data.

"""We observe a wide range of growth rates and population densities across different countries. Some countries exhibit high population densities with moderate growth rates, while others have lower densities and higher growth rates. This variation underscores the diverse demographic dynamics at play worldwide and concludes small to no correlation between rowth rates and population densities, as proven in the following chapter.

## Correlation Matrix

Finally, let's create a correlation matrix to further our understanding of the relationships between the numerical variables in our dataset. We'll use the `corr()` method, applying the spearman rank correlation, to calculate the correlation coefficients and the `heatmap()` function from `seaborn` to create the heatmap.

### Spearman Rank Correlation

We employ the Spearman rank correlation method to examine the relationships between various variables in our dataset, including rank, population, area, and others. The Spearman method is a non-parametric measure of correlation that assesses the monotonic relationship between two variables, making it suitable for analyzing our dataset, which may not adhere to the assumptions of linear correlation methods.

The Spearman rank correlation method is preferred for our dataset due to several key characteristics:

1. **Non-Parametric Nature:** The Spearman method does not assume a linear relationship between variables, making it suitable for datasets with non-linear or non-normal distributions. Our dataset, which includes diverse demographic and geographic variables, may not conform to linear assumptions, making the Spearman method a more appropriate choice.

2. **Monotonic Relationship:** The Spearman method assesses the monotonic relationship between variables, which is a more general form of association than linear correlation. This allows us to capture any increasing or decreasing trends between variables without relying on specific functional forms.

3. **Robustness to Outliers:** The Spearman method is less sensitive to outliers compared to linear correlation methods, making it more robust in the presence of extreme values. Our dataset includes variables such as rank and population, which may have outliers that could skew the results of linear correlation methods.

4. **Ranking of Data:** The Spearman method operates on the ranks of the data rather than the actual values, which can be advantageous when dealing with ordinal or categorical variables. This allows us to assess the relationship between variables without making assumptions about the underlying scale of measurement.

In summary, the Spearman rank correlation method is the preferred choice for our dataset due to its non-parametric nature, ability to capture monotonic relationships, robustness to outliers, and suitability for variables with ordinal or categorical characteristics. By employing the Spearman method, we can gain valuable insights into the associations between various demographic and geographic variables in our dataset.

"""## Skewedness of Population Density

In this section, we employ a box plot to scrutinize the skewedness of population density across various countries. The box plot is a robust tool for visualizing the distribution of a dataset, highlighting key statistical measures such as the median, quartiles, and outliers. By examining the spread of population density values, we aim to discern any notable patterns or disparities in the distribution.
"""

# Extract the relevant columns
population_density = df['Density (per km²)']

# Plot the box plot

plt.boxplot(population_density, vert=False)

plt.xlabel('Population Density (per km²)')
plt.title('Distribution of Population Density')
plt.xscale('log')

plt.show()

"""The box plot of population density reveals a right-skewed distribution, with a majority of countries exhibiting lower population densities. The median population density, indicated by the line within the box, is relatively low, suggesting that most countries have a population density below this value. The interquartile range, represented by the box, encompasses the middle 50% of the data and is notably wider on the lower end, indicating a greater dispersion of lower population density values.

The whiskers of the box plot extend to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 times the interquartile range from the first and third quartiles, respectively. This suggests that while most countries have lower population densities, there are a few outliers with significantly higher population densities. These outliers may represent densely populated urban areas or regions with unique demographic characteristics such as Monaco, Macau, HongKong or Singapore.

## Interesting Findings

Based on the EDA, we can observe the following interesting findings:

1. There is a strong positive correlation between the population of countries in 2022 and their populations in previous years.
2. The distribution of population density is right-skewed, indicating that most countries have a low population density.
4. The correlation matrix reveals that there is a moderate positive correlation between the population of countries and their area size.

By performing this EDA, we have gained valuable insights into the world population dataset, its features and their relation, which will help us in further analyses and modeling in the subsequent chapters.

# 4. Hypotheses & Modeling Approach

In this chapter, hypotheses will be formulated based on the Exploratory Data Analysis conducted in the previous chapter. Each hypothesis will be clearly stated, and relevant statistical tests or visualizations will be discussed to investigate the hypothesis. Following this, the most suitable model will be selected based on extensive research. Finally, an interpretation of the results will be provided to determine whether the hypothesis is supported or not.

## **Hypothesis 1: Predicting Population Using ARIMA**

**Hypothesis:** ARIMA models can accurately predict the population of each country based on our historical population dataset.

**Statistical Test:** We will fit an ARIMA and SARIMA model to the historical population data of each country and evaluate the accuracy of the predictions using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

**Visualization:** We will create time series plots to visualize the historical population data and the predicted values from the ARIMA model.

**Interpretation:** If the models produces accurate predictions with low error metrics, it would support the hypothesis, indicating that that model can be used to predict the population of each country.

## **Hypothesis 2: Correlation between Area and Population**

**Hypothesis:** There is an active correlation between the area and population of a country, with larger countries tending to have higher populations.

**Statistical Test:** We will calculate the correlation coefficient between the area and population of each country using the `corr()` method.

**Visualization:** We will create scatter plots to visualize the relationship between the area and population of each country.

**Interpretation:** If the correlation coefficient is positive and statistically significant, it would support the hypothesis, indicating that larger countries tend to have higher populations.

## **Hypothesis 3: Dataset Suitability for Machine Learning**

**Hypothesis:** The dataset is not well-suited for machine learning tasks, as it lacks features that are typically used in ML models, such as categorical variables, text data, or time series data.

**Discussion:** We will explore the dataset to identify the types of variables present and assess their suitability for machine learning tasks. This will involve examining the distribution and characteristics of the variables, as well as considering the types of questions that can be answered using the dataset. We will also compare the dataset to other datasets that are commonly used in machine learning to determine its relative suitability for ML tasks.

**Interpretation:** If the dataset lacks features that are typically used in machine learning models, it would support the hypothesis, indicating that the dataset may be better suited for statistical data analysis rather than machine learning. However, if the dataset contains useful information that can be leveraged for predictive modeling, it would suggest that the dataset is suitable for machine learning tasks.

# Modeling

## Modeling Population

### Philippines

In this chapter, we aim to model the population of the Philippines using two popular time series forecasting methods: ARIMA and SARIMA. We will begin by fitting both models to the historical population data of the Philippines and evaluating their performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Once we have obtained the forecasts from both models, we will analyze the results and discuss the differences between the two models and their applicability to the dataset. This will include a discussion on the assumptions and limitations of each model, as well as any insights gained from the analysis.

By comparing the performance of ARIMA and SARIMA models on the population data of the Philippines, we aim to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model and their suitability for forecasting population data in a real-world scenario.

"""#### ARIMA Model:

- **Approach**: The ARIMA model is a popular time series forecasting method that models the next value in a series based on linear regression of the previous values and the errors. The ARIMA model used here is of order (5,1,0), indicating the use of an autoregressive model with a lag of 5, differencing order of 1, and no moving average component.
- **Reasoning**: The ARIMA model is a good starting point for time series forecasting as it is relatively simple and can capture linear trends and seasonality.
- **Assumptions**: The ARIMA model assumes that the time series data is stationary, meaning that the mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure do not change over time.
- **Limitations**: The ARIMA model does not account for external factors that may influence the time series, such as economic indicators or policy changes. It also assumes that the relationship between the variables is linear.

#### SARIMA Model:

- **Approach**: The SARIMA model is an extension of the ARIMA model that includes seasonality. The SARIMA model used here is of order (1, 1, 1) with a seasonal order of (1, 1, 1, 12), indicating the use of an autoregressive model with a lag of 1, differencing order of 1, moving average component of 1, and a seasonal component with a lag of 12 (representing monthly seasonality).
- **Reasoning**: The SARIMA model is suitable when the time series data exhibits seasonality, which is common in many real-world datasets.
- **Assumptions**: The SARIMA model assumes that the seasonal component is predictable and that the time series data is stationary after differencing.
- **Limitations**: The SARIMA model may not perform well if the seasonality is not well-defined or if there are significant outliers in the data. It also assumes that the relationship between the variables is linear.

#### Comparison:

- **Forecast**: The ARIMA model provides more accurate forecasts for the Philippines population compared to the SARIMA model. The ARIMA model forecasts a steady increase in population, while the SARIMA model forecasts a constant population.
- **MAE and RMSE**: The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are lower for the ARIMA model, indicating that it has a better fit to the data compared to the SARIMA model.
- **Overall**: In this case, the ARIMA model is a better choice for forecasting the population of the Philippines due to its better performance metrics and more realistic forecasts. However, it's important to note that the choice of model depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the objectives of the analysis.

### Each Country

In this chapter, we aim to model the population of each country using the ARIMA model, proven superior to the task in the previous chapter. We will begin by fitting the ARIMA model to the historical population data of each country and evaluating its performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Once we have obtained the forecasts from the ARIMA model for each country, we will analyze the results and discuss the differences in the model's performance across different countries. This will include a discussion on the factors that may affect the model's accuracy, such as the availability and quality of historical population data, the choice of model parameters, and the presence of outliers or irregularities in the data.

By comparing the performance of the ARIMA model across different countries, we aim to provide insights into the factors that may influence the accuracy of population forecasts and the challenges involved in modeling population data using time series forecasting methods.

#### Discussion

1. **Model Performance:**
   - The ARIMA model shows good overall performance, with a mean MAE of 0.070 and a mean RMSE of 0.076. This indicates that, on average, the model's predictions are within 7% of the actual population values.
   - However, the model's performance varies significantly across different countries, as indicated by the top 5 countries with the highest MAE. For example, MSR and NIU have relatively high MAE values, suggesting that the model's predictions for these countries are less accurate compared to others.

2. **Factors Affecting Model Performance:**
   - The accuracy of the ARIMA model's predictions depends on various factors, such as the availability and quality of historical population data, the choice of model parameters (e.g., order of differencing), and the presence of outliers or irregularities in the data.
   - Countries with smaller populations or unique demographic characteristics may be more challenging to model accurately due to their specific dynamics and trends.

3. **Limitations and Future Work:**
   - The ARIMA model assumes that the time series data is stationary, which may not always be the case for population data, especially in countries experiencing rapid demographic changes.
   - The model's performance can be further improved by incorporating additional features or using more advanced time series models that can capture complex patterns and relationships in the data.
   - Future work could explore the use of other forecasting techniques, such as machine learning models or ensemble methods, to improve the accuracy of population predictions for different countries.

#### Conclusion

Overall, while the ARIMA model provides a useful framework for forecasting population trends, its performance can vary depending on the specific characteristics of each country's population data. Further research and experimentation with different modeling approaches are essential to refine and improve the accuracy of population predictions.

## Correlation Area & Population

In this chapter, we explore the relationship between a country's area and its population. Our hypothesis is that there is an active correlation between the two, with larger countries tending to have higher populations. We will conduct a statistical test to calculate the correlation coefficient between the area and population of each country. Additionally, we will visualize this relationship using scatter plots. The interpretation of the correlation coefficient will help us understand the extent to which area and population are related, and whether larger countries indeed tend to have higher populations.

"""### Analysis

The calculated correlation coefficient of 0.4534 suggests a moderate positive correlation between the area and population of countries. This indicates that, on average, larger countries tend to have higher populations. However, the correlation is not particularly strong, suggesting that other factors may also play a significant role in determining a country's population size.

### Discussion

One possible explanation for this moderate correlation could be the availability of resources and infrastructure in larger countries. Larger countries often have more resources and land available for agriculture, industry, and urban development, which can support larger populations. Additionally, larger countries may have more diverse climates and landscapes, which can attract people to settle in different regions.

It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. While a positive correlation between area and population is observed, it does not necessarily mean that a larger area directly causes a higher population. Other factors, such as economic development, political stability, and cultural factors, can also influence population size.

Overall, the moderate positive correlation between area and population suggests that there is a relationship between these two variables, but it is not the sole determinant of population size.

# Project Conclusion

## Hypothesis 1

Based on the analysis conducted, we can conclude that the ARIMA model can be used to accurately predict the population of each country based on historical population data. The ARIMA model produced predictions with low error metrics, as indicated by the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values. This suggests that the ARIMA model is a suitable choice for forecasting population data and can provide valuable insights into population trends and patterns.

However, it is important to note that the accuracy of the ARIMA model may be influenced by various factors, such as the availability and quality of historical population data, the choice of model parameters, and the presence of outliers or irregularities in the data. Therefore, it is essential to carefully consider these factors when using the ARIMA model for population forecasting.

Overall, the results of this analysis support the hypothesis that ARIMA models can accurately predict the population of each country based on historical population data. This suggests that the ARIMA model can be a valuable tool for policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders interested in understanding and forecasting population trends.

## Hypothesis 2

The correlation coefficient of 0.4534113215782557 indicates a moderate positive correlation between a country's area and its population. This means that as the area of a country increases, its population tends to increase as well, and vice versa. However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation. Therefore, while larger countries may tend to have higher populations, this does not necessarily mean that the size of a country directly causes its population to be higher. Other factors, such as economic development, political stability, and cultural factors, may also play a significant role in determining a country's population size.

## Hypothesis 3

Based on the analysis conducted, I've have found that the dataset is not well-suited for machine learning tasks. Several factors contribute to this conclusion:

1. **Static Variables**: The dataset primarily consists of static variables such as area, which do not change over time. This lack of variation makes it difficult for machine learning models to identify patterns and make accurate predictions.

2. **Variables Based on Each Other**: Many variables in the dataset are based on each other, such as population density, rank based on population, and growth rate. This high degree of correlation between variables can lead to multicollinearity issues in machine learning models.

3. **Few Independent Variables**: The dataset lacks a diverse range of independent variables that can be used to predict population changes accurately. This limitation restricts the ability of machine learning models to make accurate predictions.

4. **Short Timespan of Data**: The dataset spans only 50 years, which is a relatively short timespan for machine learning models to learn from. Longer timespans allow models to capture more complex patterns and trends.

5. **Low Data Density**: The dataset only provides population values every 10 years, resulting in a low data density. Machine learning models typically require a higher frequency of data points to learn and generalize patterns effectively.

6. **Missing Variables**: The dataset is missing important variables that are typically used in population calculation, such as economic status, political climate, and geographic location. These missing variables can significantly impact the accuracy of machine learning models.

In conclusion, while the dataset provides valuable information about population trends and patterns, it is not well-suited for machine learning tasks due to its static nature, low data density, short timespan, limited independent variables, and missing variables. Instead, the dataset is better suited for statistical data analysis, where the focus is on understanding and interpreting the data rather than making predictions.

## Ethnic Complications

The dataset used in this Project is a list of countries or territories with various demographic and geographical information. It includes information like the country's rank, the country or territory name, its capital, continent, population data for various years, area in square kilometers, population density per square kilometer, growth rate, and world population percentage.

Regarding ethnic complications, it's important to note that ethnicity is a complex and multifaceted concept that can't be directly inferred from the data in this dataset. Ethnicity often involves cultural, linguistic, and historical factors that are not captured in demographic statistics alone. Additionally, ethnicity can be a sensitive and subjective topic, and it's crucial to approach it with care and respect for the diversity of experiences and identities within each country or territory.

Therefore concluding no direct ethnic or lawful complications on using and working with the used worldpopulation dataset.

## Personal Conclusion

As I reflect on this project, I am excited about the potential for future work and improvements. To enhance the quality and scope of our analysis, I suggest incorporating additional variables such as urbanization rates, fertility rates, political situation, economic status, and migration patterns. This could provide a more comprehensive understanding of demographic trends. Additionally, conducting a comparative analysis between countries or regions could yield valuable insights into global population dynamics. Finally, expanding the temporal scope of the dataset to include earlier historical periods could provide valuable insights into long-term population trends and their relationship with historical events and processes.

I've found that project rather interesting and provided me with valuable learnings that I can apply in future projects. However, I feel that the dataset chosen for this analysis was not the best fit for the project's objectives, and I'm rather disappointed with the scope of the dataset recommendation. Additionally, while I appreciated the opportunity to work on this project, I believe that the course could have provided more mathematical and statistical basis for the machine learning techniques used. But I understand that in the end there is only one week and therefore corners must be cut. I underestimated the importance of hypothesis formulation and modeling approach in the project, and I would like to explore these aspects further in future projects.
